To fix heroku file security issues i checked in the 3 coldstorage files, and then to have git stop tracking them I had to use :

Had the very same issue this week when I accidentally committed, then tried to remove a build file from a shared repository, and this:

http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/18/temporarily-ignoring-files.html

has worked fine for me and not mentioned so far.

git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
To remove the file you're interested in from version control, then use all your other commands as normal.

git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>
If you ever wanted to put it back in.

so I ran this


no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[coldstorage (master)]$ gs
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   .gitignore
#	modified:   files/PRIVATE/NON-ENCRYPTED/private_keys.csv
#	modified:   files/PRIVATE/encrypted/private_keys.csv.aes
#	modified:   files/public/addresses.csv
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[coldstorage (master)]$ git update-index --assume-unchanged files/PRIVATE/NON-ENCRYPTED/private_keys.csv
[coldstorage (master)]$ git update-index --assume-unchanged files/PRIVATE/encrypted/private_keys.csv.aes
[coldstorage (master)]$ git update-index --assume-unchanged files/public/addresses.csv
